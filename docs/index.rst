TimeClock User Guide
====================


Introduction
------------

TimeClock [#fullname]_ is a simple time clock reporting tool for the
`GNU/Emacs`_ mode: timeclock_. It's a command line tool that reads a
timelog and prints a report to the console. By default the report
looks something like this::

                     =====================================
                     Daily Report Mon Dec  3 16:52:44 2012
                     =====================================
    
    * Thu 2012/03/15 (08:07:06 - 16:15:14) *

    | Total Daily Hours                                            |  8.14 |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | Afternoon                                                    |  3.05 |

    | FirstCheckIn                                                 |  4.07 |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
    | Lunch                                                        |  1.02 |
    +--------------------------------------------------------------+-------+
    
    TOTAL = 8.14 hours
    PERIOD = 1 days
    AVERAGE = 8.14 hours/day
    

But it is also possible to generate a report formatted as HTML or
CSV.

Installing TimeClock
--------------------

TimeClock is written in Perl_. If you already have Perl installed you
can install TimeClock using CPAN::

    $ cpan App::TimeClock

Configuration
-------------

If you haven't changed your `GNU/Emacs`_ setup, no configuration is
needed. The script will read your timelog file from the default
location which is ``~/.timelog``

If you have changed the location of the timelog file (e.g placing it
in a Dropbox folder), you can create the file ``~/.timeclockrc`` and
define the location of the timelog file there. Example::

    $timelog = "$ENV{HOME}/Dropbox/timelog";
