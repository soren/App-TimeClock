App::TimeClock User Guide
=========================

App::TimeClock is a simple timeclock reporting tool. It's writting in
Perl, which means you'll need Perl installed on your machine.

App::TimeClock generates reports based on a timelog. The easiest way
to generate the timelog is by using GNU/Emacs and the timeclock mode.
