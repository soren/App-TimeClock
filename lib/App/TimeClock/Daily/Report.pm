=head1 NAME

App::TimeClock::Daily::Report

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Can parse the timelog and generate a report using an instance of a
L<App::TimeClock::Daily::PrinterInterface>.

=head2 METHODS

=over

=item new($timelog, $printer)

Initializes a new L<App::TimeClock::Daily::Report> object.

Two parameters are required:

=over

=item B<$timelog>

Must point to a timelog file. Will die if not.

=item B<$printer>

An object derived from L<App::TimeClock::Daily::PrinterInterface>. Will die if not.

=back

    die "must supply (timelog, printer) arguments to constructor" if $#_ != 2;
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = {
        timelog => shift,
        printer => shift,
    };
    die "timelog ($self->{timelog}) does not exist" unless -f $self->{timelog} and -r $self->{timelog};
    die "printer is not a PrinterInterface" unless ref $self->{printer} and
	  UNIVERSAL::can($self->{printer},'isa') and $self->{printer}->isa("App::TimeClock::Daily::PrinterInterface");
    bless $self, $class;
};


=item _timelocal() 

Returns a time (seconds since epoch) from a date and time.

=cut
sub _timelocal {
    my ($self, $date, $time) = @_;
    my ($year, $mon, $mday) = split(/\//, $date);
    my ($hours, $min, $sec ) = split(/:/, $time);

    return timelocal($sec, $min, $hours, $mday, $mon-1, $year);
};


=item _get_report_time()

Returns the time when the report was executed.

=cut
sub _get_report_time { $_[0]->{_report_time} || time }


=item _set_report_time()

Sets the time when the report is executed.

Two parameters are required:

=over

=item B<$date>

The date as a string in the following format YYYY/MM/DD

=item B<$time>

The time as a string in the following format HH:MM:SS

=back

=cut
sub _set_report_time { $_[0]->{_report_time} = $_[0]->_timelocal($_[1], $_[2]) }


=item _read_lines()

Reads a set of check in and check out lines.

If end of file is reached after reading the check in line, then
reading of the check out line is skipped.

=cut
sub _read_lines {

    my ($self, $file) = (@_);
    my ($iline, $oline) = (undef, undef);

    die "Prematurely end of file." if eof($file);

    ($iline = <$file>) =~ s/\R//g;

    die "Expected check in in line $." unless $iline =~ /^i /;

    if (not eof($file)) {
        ($oline = <$file>) =~ s/\R//g;
        die "Excepted check out in line $." unless $oline =~ /^o /;
    }

    return ($iline, $oline);
}


=item _parse_lines()

Parses a set of check in and check out lines.

The lines are split on space and should contain the following four
fields:

=over

=item state 

is either 'i' - check in or 'o' - check out.

=cut

=item date 

is formatted as YYYY/MM//DD

=cut

=item time

is formatted as HH:MM:SS

=cut

=item project

is then name of the project/task and is only required when checking in.

=cut

=back

=cut

    my ($self, $file) = (@_);
    my ($iline, $oline) = $self->_read_lines($file);

}


=item execute()

Opens the timelog file starts parsing it, looping over each day and
calling print_day() for each.
